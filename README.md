🔧 Note about test mocks

- `contracts/test/mocks/MockUSDC.sol` is a simple ERC-like mock used in tests and fuzzing.
- `mint(address,uint256)` increases both the recipient balance and `totalSupply` and may mint to arbitrary addresses (used by fuzz tests). Tests should not assume all minted tokens are held by a fixed set of tracked accounts.
